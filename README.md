# Stock Price Prediction with ARIMA and LSTM
The two datasets used for analysis are the daily stock prices from September 3, 2019, to August 31, 2021, of Southwest Airlines Co. and Netflix Inc. from Yahoo Finance. 
For each dataset, the date and close prices in US dollars are being analyzed and predicted using two methods, which are ARIMA (Autoregressive integrated moving average) 
and LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory). 

The goal of this project is to explore which approach predict and forecast time series better.

For this project, LSTM has a better predicting power than ARIMA model for both stock price datasets, and forecasted the trends correctly.
